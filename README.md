# Front-End-Webpage-Dump
A Repository for the front-end parts of a website I will be making. 
There will be a lot of html and javacript files and I will be combining them later in a webapp that I will be deploying. The webapp will show off some of the front-end
skills I will hopefully obtain doing this as well having a database project as well. The webpage will have the interactive database as well all the different looking pages
showing off how cool I am.
